# mobx-state-tree-normalizr

Mobx-state-tree-normalizr helps you normalize data with [mobx-state-tree's](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree) model definition.

## Install

Install from NPM repository using yarn or npm

```javascript
npm install mobx-state-tree-normalizr
```

```javascript
yarn add mobx-state-tree-normalizr
```

## Motivation

[Mobx-state-tree](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree) provides a way to denomalize related data with reference but lacks of data normalization support. In order to nomalize the data retrieved from the backend service, people may use third-party libraries like [normalizr](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr). However, these kinds of packages may need you to define another schema other than mobx-state-tree built-in `type.model` for a specific resource which will introduce duplication to the schema definition.

Mobx-state-tree-normalizr is tool that aims to normalize your data based on mobx-state-tree built-in `types.model` without third-party schema definition.

**Notes**: If you are not familiar with the nomalization term, please take a look at its [documentation](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr) for more information.

## Instructions

### normalize

mobx-state-tree-normalizr only provide a method call `normalize`, it take two params:

1. First parameter: `originalData`(the nested data you might fetch from somewhere)
2. Second parameter: `model`(the model of [mobx-state-tree](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree))

#### parameter: model

We use [mobx-state-tree](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree)'s `types.model` to normalize our data. But because model in mst is very powerful and elastic, we need some constraints when you define your model:

1. Mobx-state-tree-normalizr use model's name to define your entity type, so you should define your model like this `types.model('some name', {....})`. If the name parameter is not given, We will consider that this model corresponds to not an entity.

2. An entity must have a primary key distinguishing itself from other entities with the same type. The primary key will be the attribute with the `types.identifier` type in your model if provided and will use `id` as the default value.

## Usage

The original data might look like this:

```javascript
const originalData = {
  id: '123',
  title: 'My awesome blog post',
  author: {
    id: '1',
    name: 'Nana',
    gender: 'm'
  }
}
```

Now, when we use mobx-state-tree, we can build a model for this data structure like this:

```javascript
import { types } from 'mobx-state-tree'

const User = types.model('user', {
  id: types.identifier,
  name: types.string,
  gender: types.enumeration('gender', ['m', 'n'])
})

const Article = types.model('article', {
  id: types.string,
  title: types.string,
  author: types.maybe(types.reference(types.late(() => User)))
})
```

After that, we can use these models as schemas to normalize our nested data

```javascript
import normalize from 'mobx-state-tree-normalizr'

const normalizedData = normalize(originalData, Article)
```

Now, normalizedData will be:

```javascript
{
  result: '123',
  entities: {
    'article': {
      '123': {
        id: '123',
        title: 'My awesome blog post',
        author: '1'
      }
    },
    'user': {
      '1': {id: '1', name: 'Nana', gender: 'm'}
    }
  }
}
```
